  ABSTRACT = {Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors have accrued an ever-increasing presence in the agricultural sector due to their non-destructive mode of capturing data. LiDAR sensors emit pulsed light waves that return to the sensor upon bouncing off surrounding objects. The distances that the pulses travel are calculated by measuring the time for all pulses to return to the source. There are many reported applications of the data obtained from LiDAR in agricultural sectors. LiDAR sensors are widely used to measure agricultural landscaping and topography and the structural characteristics of trees such as leaf area index and canopy volume; they are also used for crop biomass estimation, phenotype characterisation, crop growth, etc. A LiDAR-based system and LiDAR data can also be used to measure spray drift and detect soil properties. It has also been proposed in the literature that crop damage detection and yield prediction can also be obtained with LiDAR data. This review focuses on different LiDAR-based system applications and data obtained from LiDAR in agricultural sectors. Comparisons of aspects of LiDAR data in different agricultural applications are also provided. Furthermore, future research directions based on this emerging technology are also presented in this review.},

  ABSTRACT = {The development of light detection and ranging (lidar) technology began in the 1960s, following the invention of the laser, which represents the central component of this system, integrating laser scanning with an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and Global Positioning System (GPS). Lidar technology is spreading to many different areas of application, from those in autonomous vehicles for road detection and object recognition, to those in the maritime sector, including object detection for autonomous navigation, monitoring ocean ecosystems, mapping coastal areas, and other diverse applications. This paper presents lidar system technology and reviews its application in the modern road transportation and maritime sector. Some of the better-known lidar systems for practical applications, on which current commercial models are based, are presented, and their advantages and disadvantages are described and analyzed. Moreover, current challenges and future trends of application are discussed. This paper also provides a systematic review of recent scientific research on the application of lidar system technology and the corresponding computational algorithms for data analysis, mainly focusing on deep learning algorithms, in the modern road transportation and maritime sector, based on an extensive analysis of the available scientific literature.},

abstract = {Herein, point light detection and ranging inertial odometry (LIO) is presented: a robust and high-bandwidth light detection and ranging (LiDAR) inertial odometry with the capability to estimate extremely aggressive robotic motions. Point-LIO has two key novelties. The first one is a point-by-point LIO framework that updates the state at each LiDAR point measurement. This framework allows an extremely high-frequency odometry output, significantly increases the odometry bandwidth, and fundamentally removes the artificial in-frame motion distortion. The second one is a stochastic process-augmented kinematic model which models the IMU measurement as an output. This new modeling method enables accurate localization and reliable mapping for aggressive motions even with inertial measurement unit (IMU) measurements saturated in the middle of the motion. Various real-world experiments are conducted for performance evaluation. Overall, Point-LIO is capable to provide accurate, high-frequency odometry (4–8 kHz) and reliable mapping under severe vibrations and aggressive motions with high angular velocity (75 rad s−1) beyond the IMU measuring ranges. Furthermore, an exhaustive benchmark comparison is conducted. Point-LIO achieves consistently comparable accuracy and time consumption. Finally, two example applications of Point-LIO are demonstrated, one is a racing drone and the other is a self-rotating unmanned aerial vehicle, both have aggressive motions.},
