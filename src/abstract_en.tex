Achieving effective multi-agent \ac{UAV} coordination without explicit communication, alongside robust single-agent navigation in complex, \ac{GNSS}-denied environments, presents significant research challenges.
Therefore, developing robust algorithms capable of handling these demanding conditions is necessary.
This thesis addresses these challenges through two primary objectives. 
The first objective is to extend the \ac{RBL} algorithm for multi-agent coordination from two to three dimensions, introducing new rules for enhanced performance. 
The second objective involves implementing and validating this 3D \ac{RBL} framework for single \ac{UAV} navigation in a real-world forest environment using \ac{LiDAR} sensing.

The 2D \ac{RBL} algorithm was extended to 3D by building upon its foundational concepts and introducing new rules for vertical control. 
For single-agent forest navigation, this 3D \ac{RBL} was integrated with \ac{LiDAR}-based perception, utilizing Point-LIO for state estimation and a voxel-based mapping approach. 
The system was evaluated through multi-agent simulations and real-world flight experiments in a forest.

Simulations demonstrated the successful extension of \ac{RBL} to 3D, showing improved multi-agent coordination efficiency, particularly with more agents. 
Real-world experiments validated the effectiveness of the implemented system for autonomous point-to-point navigation in a forest, though challenges with mapping dynamic environmental elements like leaves were identified as a limitation.

In summary, this thesis validates the modification and real-world use of the \ac{RBL} algorithm for 3D \ac{UAV} point-to-point navigation.
While the need for enhanced mapping is needed, the results of this study significantly contribute to the development of more independent and adaptable \ac{UAV} systems.

% The study of autonomous \acp{UAV} has become a prominent sub-field of mobile robotics.
